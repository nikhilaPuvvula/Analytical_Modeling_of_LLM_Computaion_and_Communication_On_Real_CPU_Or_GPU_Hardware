# Problem Definition
Current hardware and software optimizations for LLMs lack a generalized performance prediction model. Training and deploying LLMs efficiently requires understanding the balance between:

•	Computation: How different transformer operations impact execution time.

•	Memory Access: The role of caching, prefetching, and attention optimization.

•	Communication Delays: The impact of interconnect bandwidth on scaling performance.

This project seeks to answer:

I.	How does LLM execution scale across single-GPU, multi-GPU, and multi-node systems?

II.	What are the dominant bottlenecks—compute-bound, memory-bound, or communication-bound?

III.	Can we develop a mathematical performance model to predict LLM inference/training time?

IV.	What are the best optimization strategies to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency?

By addressing these questions, this project will bridge the gap between AI model efficiency and hardware optimization, contributing to scalable and sustainable AI computing.
